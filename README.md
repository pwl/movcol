movcol
======

Refreshed version of MOVCOL algorithm, originaly implemented in Fortran 77 by W. Huang and R. D. Russell [1].
The repository includes all auxlilary libraries needed to run MOVCOL, such as DASSL and LINPACK.
I didn't test it with any other compiler than ifort, but it should work with gfortran.
